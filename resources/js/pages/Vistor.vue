        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
          This app seeks to solve a well known problem among people who are paid on
          a bi-weekly schedule: monthly bills, but not monthly paychecks.<br>
          Most budgetting apps don't let you define bi-weekly paychecks.<br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>
          Enter Budgeteer. Budgeteer gives you the flexibility to specify when you
          get paid and do projections on bills and paychecks. Then create associations.<br>
          That is, "pair" bills and paychecks together so that every paycheck you know what
          has to go to bills and what is left over.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Other Notes</h3>
        <p>
          Unlike other heavyweight budgetting apps, Budgeteer doesn't track expenses for you.
          That's beyond the scope of the problem that Budgeteer seeks to solve.
          Rather than try to solve a huge problem mediocrely, we seek to solve a smaller problem exceptionally.
          Just bills and paychecks.
