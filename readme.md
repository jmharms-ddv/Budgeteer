# Budgeteer

Budgeteer is a simple low-complexity budget app for those people who are concerned with really only one aspect of a budget: making sure bills get paid and you're not left broke.
With this "bill first" mindset, this is aimed at the niche group of people who have monthly bills, but are paid every two weeks.
This is actually quite a lot of people. So, why Budgeteer? Let me break down the problem this app solves:

## The Problem

- Monthly bills = 12 bill/year
- Paid every two weeks = 52 paychecks/year

If you're like me and live off of two paychecks to cover monthly expenses, this represents a conundrum.
- 52/2 = 26
- 26/2 = 13
- 13, not 12.

So, I get paid for 13 "months", but have 12 months of bills. How do I decide what bills get paid with which paychecks? Enter Budgeteer.

## The Solution

The solution that Budgeteer gives is this: you define the monthly bills and when you get paid, assign bills to paychecks. That's it. Simple, low-complexity solution.
Currently, I'll be hosting the app on my own private server for my own private use. But here's the source code. If you like it, you can use it!

In the near future, it will live at budgeteer.ironmthome.com, for production testing purposes. If and when that happens shoot me an email if you'd like to use it. The only thing I ask is that you'd provide me with come feedback, in exchange for use of my server space. We both win! You get a soon to be great budget app and I get user feedback!

## Entered Testing Phase!

Yay! I've deployed the app at [here](https://www.budgeteer.ironmthome.com) and public registration is open. However, to be able to login in after registration you'll need to be verified. So after registration shoot budgeteer@ironmthome.com an email and I'll verify your account. As I have no documentation on how to use the app (yet) or real testing data, I may ask you to fill out a short survey about the applicaiton and tell me about any problems you had/bugs. Or submit an issue on GitHub (here). Anyways, hope those who use it find it helpful and can help me out. Cheers!
